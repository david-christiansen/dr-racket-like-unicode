* DrRacket-like Unicode input for Emacs

This is a little bit of Elisp that defines a minor mode that causes
Emacs to copy [[http://racket-lang.org][DrRacket]]'s method of inputting Unicode. Unlike Emacs
input methods that transform input as you type, DrRacket simply
provides a keybinding to transform the LaTeX-style code immediately
prior to the cursor into Unicode.

This package defines one command: =dr-racket-like-unicode-char=. This
command is similar to the one in DrRacket. It consults the
customizable table =dr-racket-like-unicode-table= to decide how to
transform the string immediately prior to point.

The package also defines a minor mode, =dr-racket-like-unicode-mode=,
that binds =C-c \= to =dr-racket-like-unicode-mode=. This can be
useful if you want to enable it only in some modes.

For an experience more like DrRacket, rebind "C-\" to
=dr-racket-like-unicode-char=, like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(global-set-key (kbd "C-\\") 'dr-racket-like-unicode-char)
#+END_SRC
